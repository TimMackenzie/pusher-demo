Introduction
------------
This simple app demonstrates using the Pusher platform to create a simple unauthenticated messaging app.

To build and deploy this, you must sign up for an account at Pusher.com and create an app.  Set the app ID, key, and secret into pusher_keys.xml.

Messages you send show up on the right, all other messages show up on the left.

Additional functionality available from the navigation drawer:
* Change the user name (automatically generated from the device ID)
* Clear messages
* Toggle between a messaging channel and the test channel (which will pop up messages in the Pusher developer console)
* Send a link to the project by email (both the share and send options do the same thing)
